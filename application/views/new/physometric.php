					<p class="bold center">First platform in the region to provide verified candidates</p>

					<p class="center">Although psychometric testing measures a candidate in a variety of areas, the basic function of psychometric testing is that it is a measurement of the mind.</p>
					<p class="center">The ability and aptitude tests give an employer an overall snapshot of an applicant’s ability and intelligence via numerical, logical and abstract testing whilst the personality test gives an idea of how the candidates deal with certain situations. </p>
					<p class="center">Within these tests, employer gets an idea of the candidate’s abilities, of how they work in given situations, what their strengths and weaknesses are, what makes them tick and how they prefer to work in given situations, how they work under pressure and how they work alone or as part of a team. </p>
					<p class="center">Rather than just relying on the candidate’s appearance, exam results or previous experience, employers can get a picture of whether a person will thrive within their company set up. </p>
					<p class="center">Psychometric testing saves time and money of the employers as there’s no need for them to sift through a mountain of applications. Our platform now filters and identifies candidates who best fit the company both through their abilities and their personality, thereby helping in employing staff most suited to the company’s culture. </p>

Cherry Hire uses 2 types of tests – a) General Aptitude Test and b) Job Specific Psychometric Test. The General Aptitude test does not have right or wrong answers. These tests assess the personality characteristic traits of candidates. This test tends to ask if a candidate would rather do one thing or another and are used to measure current or potential performance. These tests are scored based on how a person reacts to a situation. General Aptitude test is timed and it measures Numerical, Clerical, Verbal, Mechanical and Abstract reasoning. Job Specific Psychometric test aims to provide a potential employer with an insight into how well candidates work with other people, how well they handle stress and whether they will be able to cope with the intellectual demands of the job. </span></div>

			                    All kudos to Cherry Hire to fetch me my first job in Bahrain. I never imagined the process to be so simple and effective. Frankly, I thought that their process of Psychometric testing is a marketing gimmick. But, I got a call from an employer in a week’s time of taking the test and was in Bahrain within a month, working now as PHP Developer.
