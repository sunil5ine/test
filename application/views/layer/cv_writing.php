                    Whether you are just starting out or making a considered move from one role to another, your first step forward can be everything.  If you put forward the best possible representation of your professional self, you can truly test what the market thinks you are worth.  A confident summary will position you in the recruiterâ€™s mind and if you look good on paper, you will feel good about yourself, about your skills, your experience and what you have achieved.
